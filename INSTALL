Installation Instructions
=========================

DirectFB2 is built using Meson.

You will also need a C compiler and fluxcomp for converting .flux interface description files to .c files.

With the default build of DirectFB2, only one application can be running (single application core). However you have the
option to use the multi application core which allows multiple applications to run at the same time within a session.
The applications then communicate through a layer called Fusion implemented either completely in user space, or by
relying on the linux-fusion kernel module (which implements the critical parts of Fusion).

To build the single application core:

  $ meson setup build/

To build the multi application core with Fusion implemented completely in user space:

  $ meson setup -Dmulti=true build/

or with Fusion based on the linux-fusion kernel module:

  $ meson setup -Dmulti=true -Dmulti-kernel=true build/

Linux
=====

On Linux, start the build with:

  $ meson compile -C build/

And install DirectFB2 using:

  $ meson install -C build/

NuttX
=====

On NuttX, copy the DirectFB2 directory to your NuttX apps/graphics/ directory.

Verify that the following Pthread options are enabled in your NuttX configuration:

	[*] Enable mutex types
	[*] pthread cleanup stack
