Meson build system

Pure C implementation

No external dependency (except fluxcomp for converting .flux interface description files to .c files)

Modularization of the source code, which now only contains:
  - libdirect / libfusion / libdirectfb core libraries
  - a generic system module and a generic input driver for supported operating systems (only Linux for now)
    (on Linux OS, legacy FBDev or modern DRM/KMS system module and Linux input driver)
  - the default WM module
  - the DGIFF (DirectFB Glyph Image File Format) font provider
  - the DFIFF (DirectFB Fast Image File Format) image provider
  - the DFVFF (DirectFB Fast Video File Format) video provider

Separate packages for:
  - additional system modules and input drivers
  - additional WM modules
  - additional font/image/video providers
  - GFX drivers (hardware acceleration)
